What they (the scripts) do:
1. save all the files in the directory where you save the script
2. save comics in a range.
3. works only for single image comics.

To do:
1. make them accept directory, start comic and end comic through command line arguments
2. also make them work without command line arguments
3. must make them work for multi-image comics
4. merge the scripts into one

Teaching Shraddhan web scraping :D
